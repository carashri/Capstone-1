## Predicting Hospital Readmissions Using Population-Based Data

The goal of this project is to take a dataset that includes hospitalization and readmission data, along with many other health and demographic variables, and create a Machine Learning model that is able to predict hospital readmission.


### Potential Clients
The capability of predicting which patients are at higher risk of being rehospitalized would be of benefit to hospitals and healthcare organizations aimed at reducing their readmission rate.

### Data
Data from the 2015-2016 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) was used to train and test the model. NHANES 2015-2016 data can be found on the [CDC's website.](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/ContinuousNhanes/Default.aspx?BeginYear=20)

### Approach
1. Apply data wrangling, exploratory data analysis & inferential statistics on the data set.
2. For modeling, apply Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, SVM, Naive Bayes, and Gradient Boosting for this supervised learning problem.
3. Analyze potential cost savings for an average hospital in the US, based on the model's predictions.

### Python Packages Used
- Data Wrangling, Visualization, and Statistical Inference: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy
- Machine Learning: sklearn, xgboost, datetime

### Other Programs Used
- Microsoft Excel (for cost savings analysis)
